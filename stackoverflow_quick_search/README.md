# Stackoverflow quick search
A Firefox extension for quick searching Stackoverflow from the address bar.

Just type 'so' in the address bar followed by your search string and press ENTER.

Example: "so how to print a list in python nicely" and press ENTER to search "how to print a list in python nicely" in Stackoverflow.

From time to time, Stackoverflow might ask to solve a CAPTCHA to prove you're not a robot.
This is normal and happens also when you search the website manually.
